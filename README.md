The provided Python script is a basic keylogger that operates silently in the background by hiding the console window. It uses the pyHook library to intercept keyboard events, capturing keystrokes and appending them to a text file located in the user's Downloads folder. When the script starts, it initializes the output file with a header line indicating that it will record incoming keys. For each key pressed, if it is not a backspace or a null character, the script records the character in the output file. It specifically handles the Enter key by adding a newline character. The keylogger will terminate when the Ctrl + E key combination is detected. This script demonstrates fundamental keylogging functionality, useful for educational purposes regarding security and privacy awareness, but must be used responsibly and legally.
